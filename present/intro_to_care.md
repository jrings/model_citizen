# Care for data scientists and models

How to set up your organizations to be informed by data
Joerg Rings 2024



## What is a model

- Takes input data and transforms it through a mathematical/statistical process into an output
- Example: Credit card swipe fraud prediction
- Input data: Location of sale, sale category, sale amount, historical transactions etc
- Transformation: Decision trees
- Output: Likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent


## Prominent Types of Models

- Supervised (with target): Regression/classification
- Unsupervised: Clustering
- Reinforcement
- Generative: Large Language Models
- Forecasting


## Step Zero: What will change?

- Collaborate to find out: 
- What
-  is the problem the organization wants to solve
- What analysis have they done
- What are the levers
- What decisions will be changed and how are they prepared to do that
- What data is available
- Is a model needed to improve decision making?


## 

- Good/bad news:
Being data-driven means everyone’s way to work 
will change. 


## Model Lifecycle – 1: Design

- What is the problem to solve? What data is available? Who are stakeholders and supporting teams? How will you solve the problem?
- If the data scientists were your superiors, how would you prove to them you know how to change your ways based on data decisions?
- Make a small test process


## Model Lifecycle 2: Development


## 
- Building a model is more than the output. It is advanced data analysis. It will uncover deep stories about your data that have incredible value. Don't outsource them, don't rush over them.

## Model Lifecycle 3: Operation



## Model Risk



## Biggest Mistakes

- Cheap out and not do it right
- Be unprepared to manage change
- Pretend problem solving is like engineering, while it is actually a creative process
- Chase big fancy modeling methods when some very simple rules get you most of the value
- Think putting a chatbot on top relieves you of the need to clean up your mess
