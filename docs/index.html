Care for data scientists and models

How to set up your organizations 

to be informed by data

Joerg Rings 2024

## What is a model

- Takes input data and transforms it through a mathematical/statistical process into an output

---

## Prominent Types of Models

- Supervised (with target): Regression/classification
- Unsupervised: Clustering
- Reinforcement
- Generative: Large Language Models
- Forecasting

---

## Example: HELOC Dataset

- Is a home loan too risky? (FICO dataset)
- Target: Will loan be paid within 2 years?
- Some features:
  * External estimate of risk
  * Months since first trade
  * Percentage trades with balance

---

## Model Lifecycle 
 __Design__ -- What is the problem?

 __Development__ -- Use math and coding to build a solution

 __Operation__ -- Automate and monitor 


---

## 

Good/bad news: \
Being data-driven means \
everyoneâ€™s way of work will change.


---

## Model Lifecycle - 1: Design
- Collaborate to find out: 
    - What is the problem the organization wants to solve
    - What analysis have they done
    - What are the levers
    - What decisions will be changed and how are they prepared to do that
    - What data is available
    - Is a model needed to improve decision making?

---

## Model Lifecycle - 1: Design

- Thought Experiment:
- If the data scientists were your superiors, how would you prove to them you know how to change your ways based on data decisions?
- Can you do a small test using a very simplified model?
- Can you set up A/B testing of challenger model against the current baseline process?

---

## Model Lifecycle - 2: Development

- Where all the mathy and engineering happens
- Extract and transform data, engineer feature, fit algorithms
- Analyse and explain outcome
- Define decision process
- Document so it can be reproduced

---

## 

Building a model is advanced data analysis.

It lets your data tell stories.
 
_Don't outsource them, don't rush them._

---

## Example: HELOC Dataset

- Feature importance of [InterpretML Expolainable Boosting Trees
![alt text](img/feature_imp.png)
- Will relying on external risk evaluation make our model unstable?

## Model Lifecycle - 3: Operation

---

## Model Risk

![](img/wolf.png)

---

## Model Risk - Sources of Errors

* Data
* Data
* Method
* Implementation
* Lack of Monitoring
* etc etc etc

--- 

## Skills Needed

* Math
* Creativity
* Scientific Rigor
* Communication 
* Software Engineering and DevOps
* Domain Knowledge
* Judgment of "good enough"
